That’s a great addition. A "Favorite Articles" list is perfect for when you hear something fascinating while driving and want to read the full details later when you're off the road.

As for the "Add to Home Screen" issue, there are usually two reasons it fails:

The Manifest Link: Sometimes the browser needs a very specific "path" to find the manifest.json.

HTTPS: We fixed this by using GitHub, so that's good!

Let's update the code to include the Star/Favorite button and fix the app installation.

1. The Fixed manifest.json
Update your manifest.json on GitHub to look like this. I added "scope" and "id", which help Chrome recognize it as an installable app.

JSON
{
  "name": "WikiRadio",
  "short_name": "WikiRadio",
  "id": "/wikiradio/",
  "start_url": "./index.html",
  "scope": "./",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#008080",
  "theme_color": "#000080",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2991/2991148.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "any maskable"
    }
  ]
}
